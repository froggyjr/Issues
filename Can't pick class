So my friend Captinfoslie_HD joins the game so we can record a new series. But, when he tries to pick a class it says "error please login and try again". So he did still said the same thing happened we tried every class and restarted about 7 times. Please find a way to fix this. Oh, and also while your at it can you reset my classes for FroggyJrYT please that would be great thx.
